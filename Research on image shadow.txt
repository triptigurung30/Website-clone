Random notes (Box shadow, Filter)

Box shadow property in html allows us  to add shadows to an element, including images.
The syntax for using the box shadow is:
Syntax: box-shadow: offset-x offset-y blur-radius color;
Where offset-x is used for horizontal positioning of the shoadow
    offset-y is used for vertical positioningof the shadow
    blur for the blurriness of the shadow and colour for the colour of the shadow.

Next way to apply shadow is by using filter with drop shadow
The filter property, when used with the drop-shadow value, can achieve a similar shadow effect.
Syntax: filter: drop-shadow( offset-x offset-y blur-radius color );
 we can adjust blurriness, offset and color of the shadow by using filter also.
